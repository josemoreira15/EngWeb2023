                <p>The origins of the yogurt are unknown, but it was probably invented by Neolithic people in Central Asia 
                   and Mesopotamia around 5000 BC, when the first milk-producing animals were domesticated, where they most
                   likely found how to ferment milk. Some people point to different "versions" of the yogurt, like the greek
                   product known as "oxygala". The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is also recorded in some books, where those
                   books mention the word "yogurt" in different sections. Another early account of an encounter with yogurt 
                   occurs in French clinical history, where the king Francis I suffered from a severe diarrhea which no French doctor could cure. 
                   His ally, Suleiman, the Magnificent, sent a doctor, who allegedly cured the patient with yogurt. In 1919, Isaac Carasso started
                   a small yogurt business in Barcelona and named the business "Danone". Yogurt with added fruit jam was patented in 1933 by the 
                   Radlická Mlékárna dairy, in Prague.

                <p>Yogurt is made by heating milk to a temperature that denaturates its proteins (scalding), essential for making yogurt, 
                   cooling it to a temperature that will not kill the live microorganisms that turn the milk into yogurt, inoculating certain 
                   bacteria (starter culture), usually Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, into the milk, and finally keeping 
                   it warm for several hours. The milk may be held at 85 °C (185 °F) for a few minutes, or boiled (giving a somewhat different result).
                   It is typically cooled to 50 °C (122 °F) or somewhat less. That step is followed by addition of starter culture and standing
                   Milk with a higher concentration of solids than normal milk may be used. The yogurt-making process provides two significant barriers 
                   to pathogen growth, heat and acidity (low pH). Both are necessary to ensure a safe product. The initial heating of the milk kills pathogens 
                   as well as denaturing proteins. The microorganisms that turn milk into yogurt can tolerate higher temperatures than most pathogens, so 
                   that a suitable temperature not only encourages the formation of yogurt, but inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. Once the yogurt has formed 
                   it can, if desired, be strained to reduce the whey content and thicken it.</p>
